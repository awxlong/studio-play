notes about chemistry periodic table;Hey
Hydrogen's right before Helium
Lithium's too much and that's an issue
But it's okay
Hey
Beryllium it was nice to meet you
And Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, oh
I know there's Oxygen
Move to Fluorine and then Neon
Sodium don't call
Now you're looking at Magnesium
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop

Aluminium, Silicon, Phosphorus
Sulphur, Chlorine, Argon
These I know you can't afford
Potassium and then Calcium
Scandium and Titanium
Vanadium and Chromium
From Manganese back to Iron
Cobalt, Nickel and then Copper

Zinc, Gallium and Germanium
Arsenic is poisonous

You
Selenium, Bromine and Krypton
Rubidium, Strontium and Yttrium
It's insane
Stay
Don't play that Blink 182 song
And Zirconium is in Tucson
Okay

I know it's Niobium
Moving along, more elements
Molybdenum
Now you're looking at
Technetium
And I can't stop
No I can't stop

Ruthenium, Rhodium
Palladium and then Silver
Cadmium, Indium and then Tin
Antimony on your shoulder
Tellurium's off the corner
Iodine and then Xenon
From Cesium back to Barium
Lanthanum then comes Cerium

Praseodymium, Neodymium
Promethium, Samarium

So Europium then comes
Gadolinium, Terbium
Dysprosium, Holmium
Erbium back to Thulium
Ytterbium, Lutetium
Hafnium, Tantalum
Tungsten, Rhenium back to Osmium

Iridium, Platinum
Gold and then Mercury
Thallium, Lead and then comes Bismuth
Polonium, Astatine
Radon, Francium
and then Radium
Actinium and then Thorium
Protactinium and Uranium
Neptunium and Plutonium
Americium and Curium

Berkelium, Californium
Einsteinium and Fermium

So baby Mendelevium
then Nobelium, Lawrencium
Rutherfordium then Dubmium
Seaborgium, Bohrium, Hassium
Meitnerium, Darmstadtium
Roentgenium, Copernicium
Nihonium, Flerovium
Moscovium, Livermorium

From Tennessine, Oganesson
This is the periodic table
Yes this is the periodic table;
notes about biology DNA; 
Contains your genetic code
DNA, a molecule that makes up all your chromosomes
double helix structure, a two-stranded spiral
set of instructions for your cells so that they know
what to do like send nerve signals and make new bones

making proteins from acids, amino
a complete set of genetic instructions is a genome
nucleotides make chains and have three things that they’re composed
a 1. phosphate 2. nitrogen base, and 3. deoxyribose

each nucleotide base is made up from these four:
(A) Adenine, (G) Guanine, (T) Thymine, (C) Cytosine and that’s all
A always pairs with T, that’s the base pair rule
and C always pairs with G, that’s the way they go

deoxyribonucleic 
DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid yah
deoxyribonucleic 
DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid

These complementary bases, each on opposite strands
You can remember the pairs by the mnemonic GCAT
tightly controlled complex process to make a protein from a gene
It goes transcription and translation: two major steps in the journey
transcription takes information, transfers to mRNA
messenger moves to the nucleus, and onto the next stage
that is called Translation
happens in the cytoplasm, ribosomes read the codons
tRNA makes proteins one acid amino at a time

deoxyribonucleic 
DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid yeah
deoxyribonucleic 
DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid
