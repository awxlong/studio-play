### Studio&Play

I'm working on a project title Studio&Play, which explores how artificial intelligence can serve as a tool to support us in the field of education. 

Studio&Play is a natural language processing (NLP) model that transforms study notes into lyrics of a song. It's meant to help the user make study notes easier to remember through mnemonics, thus boosting memory recall performance. 

The project is in its planning and developing stage:

# 1. "Translating" study notes into song lyrics
I first want to decide which model architecture to use. I'm considering a long-short term memory seq2seq model, or the transformer architecture. If it's the former, I'll employ the code that's offered by Coursera's course on sequence models as part of the deep learning specialization by Prof. Andrew Ng. If it's the latter I plan to work on the template code for the transformer implementation available at http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html.
